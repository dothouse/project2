PSG는 2023-24시즌 프랑스 리그1 조기 우승을 확정했다. 올 시즌 PSG에 이어 프랑스 리그1 2위를 기록 중인 모나코는 29일 열린 리옹과의 2023-24시즌 프랑스 리그1 31라운드에서 2-3 패배를 당했다. 모나코는 올 시즌 리그1 3경기를 남겨 놓은 상황에서 PSG에 승점 12점 차로 뒤져 올 시즌 남은 경기 결과에 관계없이 PSG의 리그1 우승이 확정됐다.  이강인은 올 시즌 아시안컵 출전 공백에도 불구하고 리그1 20경기에 출전해 2골 2어시스트를 기록하며 우승 주역으로 활약했다. 이강인은 유럽 5대리그에서 박지성, 정우영, 김민재에 이어 한국 선수로는 4번째 우승한 선수가 됐다. 프랑스 리그1에서 우승한 한국 선수는 이강인이 최초다.  23세인 이강인은 한국 선수 중 최연소 유럽 5대리그 우승 기록도 작성했다. 이에 앞서 박지성과 김민재는 26살에 잉글랜드 프리미어리그와 세리에A에서 첫 우승을 기록했다.  이강인은 PSG와 함께 올 시즌 다양한 우승에 도전한다. 이강인은 지난 1월 열린 툴루즈와의 트로페 데 샹피옹(프랑스 슈퍼컵)에서 결승골을 터트리며 프랑스 프로축구연맹이 선정하는 경기 최우수선수에 선정되는 등 트로피를 들어 올렸다. PSG는 리그1 우승을 조기확정한 가운데 올 시즌 쿼드러플(4관왕) 도전을 이어가고 있다.  PSG는 다음달 도르트문트를 상대로 2023-24시즌 유럽축구연맹(UEFA) 챔피언스리그 4강 대결을 치른다. PSG는 쿠프 드 프랑스에선 리옹과의 결승전이 예정되어 있다. PSG는 올 시즌 UEFA 챔피언스리그 조별리그에서 도르트문트를 상대로 두 차례 대결을 치러 1승1무를 기록했고 리옹과의 두 차례 리그1 대결에선 모두 승리하기도 했다.  PSG는 올 시즌을 앞두고 메시와 네이마르가 팀을 떠났다. 반면 이강인을 포함해 10명이 넘는 선수를 영입하며 선수단을 개편했다.      프랑스 매체 퀘스트프랑스는 PSG의 리그1 우승에 대해 'PSG는 올 시즌 개인이 아닌 팀이 빛났고 새로운 시대의 초석을 다졌다. 나세르 알 켈라이피 회장이 지난 2년 동안 요구했던 것에 대한 종말을 맞이했다. PSG는 지난 여름 메시, 네이마르, 라모스, 베라티 같은 큰 스타들이 팀을 떠났고 덜 화려한 이름을 가진 이강인, 우가르테, 뎀벨레, 아센시오로 대체했다. 그들은 팀에 이름값 있는 선수들 이상으로 중요한 선수가 됐다'는 뜻을 나타냈다.  프랑스 매체 TF1은 '루이스 엔리케 감독은 대규모 선수단 운영을 주저하지 않았다. 모든 선수들을 경기에 참여시키고 조직을 돌봤다. 선수 개인보다 팀이 더 중요하다는 메시지를 보냈다. 그 결과 올 시즌 PSG에선 29명의 선수가 경기에 나섰고 그 중 19명은 500분 이상 경기에 출전했다. 음바페는 주기적으로 선발 명단에서 제외되거나 조기 교체되기도 했다'며 'PSG의 로테이션으로 이강인, 바르콜라, 베랄도, 에메리 같은 젊은 선수들이 경기에 나섰다. 베라티의 후계자로 지난 2022년 영입된 비티냐는 자신의 잠재력을 드러냈다'고 언급했다.  PSG의 나세르 알 켈라이피 회장은 리그1 조기 우승 확정 후 '리그1에서 12번째 우승을 차지한 것은 PSG와 관련된 모든 이들에게 더욱 특별하다. 루이스 엔리케 감독과 클럽의 모든 구성원들에게 축하를 전한다. 올 시즌 개막 후 팀은 매우 단결된 모습을 보였다. 올 시즌 남은 경기에서도 최선을 다할 것'이라며 쿼드러플에 대한 의욕을 드러냈다.
